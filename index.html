            The developer tools console is one of the most powerful tools available to you when it comes to debugging your front-end web applications.
             The console has an API that provides a number of methods that make debugging easier.
              It’s not uncommon to see developers using console.log() or console.dir() to investigate problems; but the developer tools console has a lot more to offer.

              ess either CTRL + SHIFT + J to open the “console” tab of the Developer Tools.
Alternative method:

Press either CTRL + SHIFT + I or F12 to open the Developer Tools.
Press ESC (or click on “Show console” in the bottom right corner) to slide the console up.

You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.
